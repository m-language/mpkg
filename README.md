# mpkg

A temporary dependency management solution for [m-language](https://github.com/m-language/m-language),
allowing package installation, dependency resolution, package publishing, and package specification.

*NOTE*
This project is not intended to be the final solution for dependency management. However, it avoids
some problems associated with the full solution to be implemented later.
